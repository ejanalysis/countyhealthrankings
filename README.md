# countyhealthrankings
The [countyhealthrankings package](http://ejanalysis.github.io/countyhealthrankings/) was developed as a way to give R users easier access to the excellent data at [countyhealthrankings.org](http://www.countyhealthrankings.org). This package provides their 2014 and 2015 datasets, imported to R as a data.frame, to facilitate use of the data in R. Source of original data is documented here: [countyhealthrankings.org/about-project](http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/about-project) -- Obtained the data 3/27/2015 and slightly modified it to provide 5-digit FIPS as a character field, and State 2-character abbreviation field renamed as ST.
