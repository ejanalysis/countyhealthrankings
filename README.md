# countyhealthrankings
I developed this package in 2015 as a way to give R users easier access to the excellent data at http://countyhealthrankings.org. 
This package provides their 2014 and 2015 datasets, imported to R as a data.frame, to facilitate use of the data in R. 
Source of original data: http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/about-project -- 
Obtained 3/27/2015 and slightly modified to provide 5 digit FIPS as character field, and ST field as copy of State field.
